Ambulatory Psychological recordings are included in these two files.

ESM.xlsx: records in the experience sampling method
	*For technical reasons, two of the participants completed seven ESM questionnaires in one day during the experiment. 

DRM.xlsx: records in the day reconstruction method
	*DRM data for ID 2025 were not available because this participant ignored the DRM questionnaire notification for all the recording days. 
	To avoid confusion, the DRM record for 2025 has been added and marked as missing data. The completion time and psychological assessment scores for 2025 were set as NaN.
